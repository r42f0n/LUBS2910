MANAGEMENT   RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS (LUBS2910)      COURSEWORK ASSIGNMENT: SEMESTER   1 (2024-2025)There are two tasks in this assignment: Task 1 and Task 2. You must complete both tasks.   Each   task   is   worth   equal   marks.   The   overall   word   limit   for   both   tasks   together   is   2000   words. You should spend around   1200 words on Task   1 and 800 words   on   Task   2.
For Task   1, you should   describe   and   evaluate the   good   practice   of   questionnaire   design   and a   plan for a quantitative data   analysis.
For Task 2, you should conduct   some   statistical   analyses   on   the   SPSS   dataset   provided   and   report the results of your   analyses. The full details of each task   are   provided   below.
TASK   1Imagine that you have been commissioned to undertake a   research   project   by   Leeds   City   Council. The   Chief   Executive   Officer (CEO) of   LCC   is concerned   that   the   employees   are   dissatisfied. There have been many anonymous complaints on social media, and the level   of staff absenteeism and turnover is on the rise. The   CEO would   like to   find   out   about   the   level   of job   satisfaction   and   about   the factors   that   might   influence   the   satisfaction   of the   employees.You have two tasks to complete for the CEO.   First, design   a   questionnaire and   develop   a   plan describing how you would like to distribute the questionnaire. Second, develop a plan   describing how you would analyse the data collected and what steps you would undertake   in the analysis process.   Further guidance on these tasks   is   provide   below.
1.       Describe and critically evaluate   how you would   design   the   questionnaire   (around   900   words).
1.1.   What key   points would you cover in the   introduction?
1.2.   What demographic and study variables would you include?      1.3.   What hypotheses would you develop using these variables?
1.4.   What are the key considerations when selecting measures for the variables?   1.5. How would you structure the questionnaire?
1.6. How    would    you    measure      your      variables?       Include    references      (if      applicable),   example   items and rating   scales.
1.7. How would you distribute the questionnaire?
Please   include the questionnaire   in the appendix   in a   word format (does   not count   in   the   overall   word   count).
2.       Describe    the    steps    you    would    take    to      perform.    the      data      analysis      and      test      your
hypotheses,   including the statistical techniques you   would use (around 300   words)
TASK   2British   universities   are   some   of   the   finest   in   the   world.   Their   excellent   reputations   are   underpinned by their historical traditions, their successful teaching and research, and their   international   social   media   presence.   The   British   university   sector   therefore   represents   a   relevant   and   interesting topic for   business   research   and   has therefore   been   selected for   your coursework assignment.Indicative    of   the    excellent    reputations    of    British    universities    is    their    high    standing    in   international university league tables. In the latest league table, produced byQuacquarelli   Symonds (QS) for 2025there are 15 British universities ranked among the   world’stop 100 universities.   The   quantitative   data   for   this   coursework   assignment   concerns   the   overall   performance      of      these       15      British      universities,      their      student      and      faculty      numbers,   sustainability,   research   power   (citation/faculty),   and   social   media   presence.   Number   of   Facebook followers was recorded on the 8th    of October.The   quantitative   SPSS   dataset   accompanying   this   assignment   that   is   drawn   from   these   sources   is   called:   University_data_2025.sav.   Please   do   not   change this dataset.   Use   it   in   its original format.You should use SPSS software to conduct the   following statistical analyses on the dataset   and   then   report   your   analyses   in the form   of the   Results   section   of a journal   paper   from   the field of Business and   Management.
Conduct   the   following   statistical   analyses   on   the   quantitative   data   in   the   SPSS   dataset:
1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation for   each   continuous   data variable.
2. Calculate the correlations   between each continuous data variable.
3.   Report the means, standard deviations, and correlations   in   a   correlation   matrix.
4.   Note,   in   particular, the   correlations   between   overall   performance   in   2025   and   each   of   the following three variables: employment outcomes in 2024,代 写LUBS2910 Management Research and Analysis Semester 1, 2024/2025R
代做程序编程语言 citations/faculty   in 2024, and   number of Facebook followers   in 2024.
5.   Draw a   line graph of the   mean overall   performance for the   British   Universities over   the   three years 2023, 2024,   and   2025.
6. Conduct and report a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to examine any   changes   in overall   performance over the three   years 2023, 2024, and 2025.
7.   Draw a   bar graph showing the   mean   number of total students   in   2024   and   total   staff   in   2024.
8. Conduct and report at-test between the number of total students in   2024   and total   staff   in   2024.
9. Conduct and report a regression analysis with   overall performance rating in 2025 as the   dependent variable and the following as   independent variables:
citations/faculty    in    2024,    employment      outcomes      in      2024,      and      number      of      Facebook   followers   in 2024.
Assignments   should   be   a   maximum   of   2000 words   in   length.All   coursework   assignments   that   contribute to the   assessment   of a   module   are   subject to   a   word   limit,   as   specified   on   the   assessment   brief.       The   word   limit   is   an   extremely   important   aspect   of   good   academic    practice,    and    must    be    adhered    to.          Unless    stated    otherwise      in    the      relevant      module   handbook   (if   one   has   been   provided),   the   word   count   includes   EVERYTHING   (i.e.   all   text   in   the   main   body   of   the   assignment      including   summaries,   subtitles,   contents      pages,   tables,   supportive      material   whether   in   footnotes   or   in-text   references)   except   the   main   title,   reference   list   and/or   bibliography   and   any   appendices.      It   is   not   acceptable   to   present   matters   of substance, which   should   be   included   in the   main   body   of   the   text, in   the   appendices   (“appendix   abuse”).    It   is   not   acceptable   to   attempt   to   hide   words in graphs and diagrams; only text which is strictly necessary should be included in graphs and diagrams.You   are   required   to   adhere   to   the   word   limit   specified   and   state   an   accurate   word   count   on   the   cover   page   of your   assignment   brief.      Your   declared   word   count   must   be   accurate,   and   should   not   mislead.   Making   a   fraudulent   statement   concerning   the   work   submitted   for   assessment   could   be   considered   academic   malpractice   and   investigated   as   such.       If   the   amount   of   work   submitted   is   higher   than   that   specified   by   the   word   limit   or   that   declared   on   your   word   count, this   may   be   reflected   in   the   mark   awarded and   noted through individual feedback given to you.
